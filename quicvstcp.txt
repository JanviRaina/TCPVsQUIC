2. Traditional Transport Protocols: TCP and UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Connection-oriented: Three-way handshake.
Reliable: Sequence numbers, acknowledgments, retransmissions.
Flow and congestion control (windowing mechanisms).
Trade-offs: Reliable but slower due to overhead.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Connectionless and lightweight.
No delivery guarantee or retransmission.
Low latency but less reliable.
3. Enter QUIC: The Next-Generation Protocol
What is QUIC?

QUIC stands for Quick UDP Internet Connections.
Developed by Google, now standardized as HTTP/3.
Combines reliability (TCP) with speed (UDP).
How QUIC Differs from TCP (Technical Comparison)

Transport Layer Basis:

TCP: Built directly over IP.
QUIC: Built over UDP but adds advanced features in the application layer.
Connection Establishment:

TCP: Requires a three-way handshake before data transfer starts.
QUIC: Combines handshake and encryption setup into a single round trip, often reducing it to zero if previously connected (using connection resumption).
Encryption:

TCP: Encryption is optional (TLS is layered on top).
QUIC: Encryption (TLS 1.3) is mandatory and built into the protocol.
Multiplexing:

TCP: Uses one stream per connection. Loss on one stream blocks the entire connection (head-of-line blocking).
QUIC: Multiplexes multiple streams over a single connection. Loss on one stream doesn’t block others.
Connection Migration:

TCP: Tied to IP addresses. Connection breaks if the client changes networks (e.g., from Wi-Fi to mobile data).
QUIC: Uses unique connection IDs, allowing seamless migration across networks.
Congestion Control:

Both protocols support congestion control, but QUIC can adapt faster because of its lower-latency design.
4. Why QUIC is Better for Low-Latency Applications
Reduced Latency in Initial Connections

QUIC reduces handshake latency, enabling rapid communication setup.
Efficient Handling of Packet Loss

QUIC’s multiplexing ensures that one lost packet doesn’t stall other streams, reducing latency impacts.
Seamless Connection Resumption

Ideal for environments with frequent network changes, such as mobile trading platforms.
Use in Electronic Trading

Critical Factors in Electronic Trading:
Milliseconds matter: QUIC's faster handshake saves valuable time.
High reliability under fluctuating network conditions: QUIC avoids TCP's blocking issues.
Real-Time Updates:
Market data streams benefit from QUIC’s ability to prioritize and deliver data efficiently.
5. Summary
QUIC blends the reliability of TCP and the speed of UDP, overcoming limitations of both.
With its advanced features, QUIC excels in low-latency environments like electronic trading, making it a game-changer for time-sensitive applications.
